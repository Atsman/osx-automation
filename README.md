# OSX automation

Got a new mac? Don't want to spend the whole weekend sitting and installing your favorite apps?
Automate that process! That what I did in this project.

I am using ansible to automate the setup and configuration of the developer's environment. So that if I got a new mac, I can easily setup it and immediately start work.
